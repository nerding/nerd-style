    <h1>Don Kuntz</h1>

    <p>
      I'm Don, and I write code. That's not all I do, but it's a rather large
      portion of what I do. When I'm not pounding on a keyboard, I'm either
      reading, watching some visual entertainment, or pretending to look
      studious. Most of my projects are on 
      <a href="https://github.com/dkuntz2">GitHub</a>, and I occasionally 
      write things over at <a href="http://dkuntz2.com/">dkuntz2.com</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm currently a sophomore Computer Science major at
      <a href="http://carthage.edu/?ext">Carthage College</a>. I ocasionally work
      on projects for <a href="http://consultvelocity.com">Velocity Consulting</a>,
      Carthage's student-run consulting agency. I am also a Computer Science Tutor.
      Like I said, writing code is a large portion of what I do.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've been programming for about six years, but only seriously for about four.
      I've worked in Python, Java, C++, Ruby, and PHP (and I've dabbled with
      several other languages). I also have experience with several web frameworks,
      including <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>, Ruby on Rails, and
      Django (as well as a myriad of PHP frameworks).
