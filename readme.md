# Nerd Style

A simple personal website template. In pure HTML, with SCSS (compiled to CSS).

The main goal of Nerd Style is to create a generic home page for someone,
specifically members of Enginerding. Mainly, it's so that there's a cohesive
brand.

Additionally, if anyone else wants to use it, they can, because it's licensed
